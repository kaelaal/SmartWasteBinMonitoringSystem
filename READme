Our project, the Smart Waste Bin Monitoring System, is designed to make waste management easier and
more efficient. It uses sensors to monitor how full a trash bin is and how much the trash weighs. When the
bin reaches a certain weight or is nearly full, the system alerts users with a buzzer. By combining a load cell,
an ultrasonic sensor, and a simple alert mechanism, our goal is to help users know exactly when itâ€™s time to
empty the bin, reducing overflow and improving cleanliness.
